# CSV Report Generator

### Summary

Using Express, this is a client-server app that generates CSV reports from JSON data.

The server flattens the JSON hierarchy, mapping each item/object in the JSON to a single line of CSV report (see included sample output), where the keys of the JSON objects will be the columns of the CSV report.
